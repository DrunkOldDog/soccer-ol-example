![soccer-trainer](https://imgur.com/84pcOXG)

This project is focused exclusively on the learning of the Openlayers React library, with the usage of Typescript and doesn't have professional endings, only educational ones. So the code was uniquely developed focused on the understaning of this library. This project has different sections separated with branches, so you can check each one to see the changes. Current Version 0.1.0.

## Project Sections

In the project branches, you can see:

### Creation and Project Structure

Creation of the project structure, adding different components, styles, types and dummy data for this project players.

### Openlayers Integration

Addition of the Openlayers library `ol` and addition of a soccer field image layer on the previously defined section.

### Players to the Field

Addition of the defined dummy players in form of dots to the field in a static position.

### Players Movement

Added randomic movement to the players with a constant that defines the limit of the field.

### Scoreboard

Addition of a Scoreboard on the Table so it displays which player has won the speed test.

**This is an educational project so you're free to copy any lines of this code**
